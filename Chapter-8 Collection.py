# ‚ú®Collection in Python: There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
'''
List: List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple: Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set: Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictinary: Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
